# NTM-JPEG

This repository is an tutorial implementation of the JPEG image compression algorithm which shows intermediate steps and evaluates them. This implementation allows modification of all parameters influencing the compression rate.
The report can be found at [Implementing_the_JPEG_Compression_Algorithm.pdf](Implementing_the_JPEG_Compression_Algorithm.pdf)
